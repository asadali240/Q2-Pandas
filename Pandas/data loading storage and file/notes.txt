book: ( python for Data Analysis) 
chapter 6

we will discuss about the chapter 5 mostly talking about the text format i.e; csv, html, different tabular formats.
in the cvs file the data shown in seperate with the (,) quoma, in the tabular file the data / filed have one tabe space.

the key points are: Data Loading, Storage and File formats. 
Topics:-
- Data reading and writing in text formats and parsing functions in pandas.
- read_csv = load delimited data from a file url or fule-like, object use comma as default delimiter.
-read_excel = read tabular data from an excel XLS or XLSX file.
- read_html = read all tables found in the given html documents.

common option on these functions:-

- Indexing: 
can treat one or more columns as the returned DataFrame, and whether the get column from the file, the use or not at all.

-values conversion:
this include the user define values, values conversion and customs list of missing values markers 

- datetime parsing 
includes combining cabability,including combining date and time information spread over multiple columns into a single columns in the result.

-iterating 
supporiting for iterating over chinks and very large files.

- unclean data issues
skipping rows or a footer, comments or other minor things like numeric data with thousand seperated commas.

data parsing is the method which have python transform the data one format / raw data into the readable format.

- when we load the csv file the DataFrame will use heading name as the columns in the DataFrame i.e Id< Name, Subject these will be used as columns in the DataFrame.
- skiprow method: this method will skip the selected row from the csv file usage e.g (skiprow = 1)  
- Note: if in the csv file or other have not a header include then you can use (header = None) method to read the csv file wihout header.

- we also apply the 2 more methods 1 is (set_index() ) 2 - is (reset_index () ) :
*now they will do the set index will convert the coulmn selected by you i.e set_index("id") into the    

-default index if we want to permenant keep this as a index we must use the inplace = True method.:
* the reset_index will revert the changes in the set_index () method.

-Hierarchical Index (pg-170):
* we can also use the (index_col) for given manual index and here is surprise that we also two index columns keys i.e (index_col = ["one", "two"] ) this is the example of index columns. 

- Reading TXT File: 
* when accesss  the data from the txt file with using (list (open(txt)) method the data cant access as per table format 
* so will use the pd.read_table ("txt") method which will show the data in the table format and we will to use the "\s+" argument to remove the white spaces
  b/w the tow columns.
* we can also read the txt file using the (read_csv) method but we must give the "\t+" argument.

-Hiding the Index: 
 we can also hide the using (df.style.hide_index()) method which will hide / remove the index from the csv file, but you cant print with this method using the 
 print () method but you can use the display() method.

# dropna() method
- parameters 
         -dropna() method by default drop all rows which have atleast 1 NaN value, the default 
         value of dropna(how = "any", axis = 0)
        
        -how = "any" / all, axis = 0/1, any with axis =0 drop all the rows which have atleast 
        one NaN and all will drop the column with axis = 1 which have all rows /columns 
        have NaN 
        
        -subset = [give the mutiple columns names] it will drop the entire given column 
        
        -thres = 2, if in the row have atleast 2 NaN values then this row cant be droped 
        
        -inplace = True, this parameter will change in original data frame permentatly.
